    <h2>History of Nearu</h2>
    <p>Nearu Self-defence was first established with the UK Martial Arts Federation and UK Amateur Martial arts by Master Amir Lotfi Azad in 1990, drawing from his years of studying various forms of martial arts and his extensive research in ancient breathing techniques</p>
    <p>NEARU started its journey in the Middle East in 1992 with only a handful of students in a basement. However today, there are more than a thousand enthusiasts practicing NEARU in Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Europe.</p>

    <h2>Philosopy of Nearu</h2>
    <p>Nearu is taught on the base of the following seven elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bravery - From the very first session, it takes a certain amount of bravery to step into something one has limited or no knowledge about.</li>
      <li>Unity - The aim of Nearru is to create fitness awareness and to educate, encourage and motivate people of all age & nationalities to stay fit & to realize the importance of exercise in order to provide a healthy & peaceful atmosphere for the individual, the family and the society as whole.</li>
      <li>Leadership - As the students move towards the higher belts they take on more responsibility within their classes as preparation for those who wish to become instructors.</li>
      <li>Sacrifice - In order to achieve our goals we must be prepared to put in the time and effort.</li>
      <li>Peace - By becoming able to defend our body and mind we learn to hold on to peace</li>
      <li>Knowledge & Self-Awareness - A person who is faced with terrible danger can produce a reaction which requires strength far beyond that of a normal human being can imagine. Inner Strength that is within all of us, and occasionally manifests itself in extreme situations.</li>
    </ul>
